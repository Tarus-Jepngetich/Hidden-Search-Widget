# Hidden-Search-Widget
This is a cool hidden search widget built as part of my daily coding challenge. Itâ€™s a sleek, interactive UI element that can be easily integrated into websites or applications.

ðŸ“‹ About the Project
The hidden search widget is a compact search bar that stays hidden until activated. When the search icon is clicked, a JavaScript event is triggered that adds an active class, expanding the widget smoothly with a CSS transition to reveal the search input field. Clicking the icon again toggles the class off, collapsing the input back to its hidden state.

This widget enhances UI/UX by offering a minimal design while keeping search functionality easily accessible.

HTML Structure: Building a clean and semantic layout for the widget

CSS Transitions: Applying smooth animations for expanding/collapsing effect
